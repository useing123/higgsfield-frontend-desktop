# Higgsfield.ai Redesign

## About The Project

This project is a hackathon redesign of higgsfield.ai, aimed at making AI models more accessible and user-friendly. The application is built around two core modes to cater to a diverse user base:

-   **Lite Mode:** A simplified, chat-based interface designed for the mass market. This mode lowers the barrier to entry, allowing new users to interact with AI models in an intuitive and conversational way.
-   **Pro Mode:** A feature-rich environment for "Pro" users who require detailed setup options and advanced controls to fine-tune their AI interactions.

## Key Features

-   **Lite vs. Pro Modes:** The application is strategically divided into two distinct modes to cater to both new and advanced users, ensuring a tailored experience for each demographic.
-   **Amplitude Analytics:** We've integrated Amplitude to track user engagement and gather insights, particularly on how non-pro users interact with the platform. This data is vital for our mission to make AI more accessible.
-   **Community Section:** A central hub for users to connect, share, and learn from one another. This section is crucial for building a network effect and fostering a collaborative environment.
-   **Easter Eggs** We strongly believe that easter eggs more viral in TikTok than any viral clip mechanics. :Dve 
## Mission

Our mission is to increase the deep usage of AI models among non-pro users. We believe that by offering a more accessible "Lite Mode" and a more affordable subscription model, we can empower a wider audience to leverage the full potential of AI.

## Roadmap

-   **"Smart" Pro Presets:** To enhance the user experience for our followers from platforms like x.com, we plan to implement URL-based presets. This feature will allow for the seamless management of over 20 presets, making it easier for users to share and access specific configurations.
